Title: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

Introduction:
In this project, we perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including demographics, cabin class, fare, and survival status. Our objective is to explore the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover trends in the data.

Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: We start by identifying missing values across different features and employ various strategies such as imputation or removal to handle them appropriately.
Data Formatting: Ensuring consistency in data formats for better analysis. This may involve converting data types, standardizing categorical variables, and addressing inconsistencies.
Removing Duplicates: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Outlier Detection and Treatment: Identifying outliers that may skew analysis results and applying suitable techniques to handle them, such as trimming or transformation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate Analysis: Examining individual variables to understand their distributions, central tendencies, and spread. This includes generating summary statistics, histograms, and box plots.
Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables to uncover potential correlations or associations. This involves scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pivot tables.
Multivariate Analysis: Investigating interactions between multiple variables simultaneously to gain deeper insights. Techniques like heatmap visualization and dimensionality reduction may be employed.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to extract meaningful information and improve predictive modeling.
Visualizations: Utilizing various graphical representations such as bar charts, pie charts, and violin plots to present findings visually and aid interpretation.
Key Findings:

Survival Rates: Analyzing survival rates based on passenger demographics (e.g., age, gender, class) to identify factors influencing survival.
Impact of Socio-Economic Status: Investigating how socio-economic factors such as passenger class and fare correlate with survival outcomes.
Family Size and Survival: Exploring the relationship between family size (e.g., siblings, parents) and survival rates.
Deck and Cabin Information: Examining the distribution of passengers across different decks and cabins and its impact on survival.
Conclusion:
Through comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory analysis, we gained valuable insights into the Titanic dataset, shedding light on various factors influencing survival. These insights can inform further analysis or modeling tasks and contribute to a deeper understanding of the Titanic tragedy and its implications. The cleaned dataset and analysis findings are available on GitHub for reference and further exploration.
